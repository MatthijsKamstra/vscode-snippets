# vscode-snippets

For Haxe development (on OSX) there is not a lot of choices in regards of an IDE or text-editor. 

My first choice is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with [haxe-sublime-bundle](https://github.com/clemos/haxe-sublime-bundle) created by Cl√©ment Charmet.

When I try a new editor (Atom, Brackets, VSCode, etc), I quickly miss typical stuff from Sublime Text or the snippets.

I wanted to give Visual Studio Code a try and missed the snippets very quickly (and for some reason `cmd+shift+d`)
It wouldn't be fare to VSCode, so I decided to even the playing field and update the snippets.

This is my complex way of updating my snippets and the default in the haxe-sublime-bundle to VScode snippets.

### My personal haxe-sublime snippets

(mck_)[haxe.json](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/mck_haxe.json) 
(mck_)[shortcuts.md](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/mck_shortcuts.md)

and the combination of the two in just one file

[haxe.json](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/haxe.json) 
[shortcuts.md](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/shortcuts.md)
