# vscode-snippets

![](vscode.png)

For Haxe development (on OSX) there is not a lot of choices in regards of an IDE or text-editor. 

My first choice is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with [haxe-sublime-bundle](https://github.com/clemos/haxe-sublime-bundle) created by [Clément Charmet}(https://github.com/clemos/).

When I try a new editor (Atom, Brackets, VSCode, etc), I quickly miss typical stuff from Sublime Text or the snippets.

I wanted to give Visual Studio Code a try and missed the snippets very quickly (and for some reason `cmd+shift+d`)
It wouldn't be fair to VSCode, so I decided to even the playing field and update the snippets.

This is my complex way of updating my snippets and the default in the haxe-sublime-bundle to VScode snippets.

## The original haxe-sublime-bundle snippets 

The converted shortcut file for VScode: (sublime) [haxe.json](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/sublime_haxe.json)

And this is a list of the shortcuts: (sublime) [shortcuts.md](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/sublime_shortcuts.md)

### My personal haxe-sublime snippets

(mck) [haxe.json](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/mck_haxe.json)   
(mck) [shortcuts.md](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/mck_shortcuts.md)

and the combination of the two in just one file

[haxe.json](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/haxe.json)   
[shortcuts.md](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/blob/master/bin/vscode/shortcuts.md)

## Keybindings

I found a couple changes I needed: [keybindings.json](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/vscode-snippets/keybindings.json)

## Future

Perhaps it would be nice to add more snippets, and generate snippets for all IDE / Editors
